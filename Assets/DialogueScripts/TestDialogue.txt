Philia|You can never understand what it is that a girl could want.
Anax|What are you even talking about?
Philia|Just think about it.
Anax|What do you want?
Philia|I don't want anything! You really don't get it do you. Just think about it.
Anax|Philia, please, I don't have time for your games.
Philia|Think about the girl that we just passed. What did she want?
Anax|Money? Looks? I don't know she seemed really desperate...
Philia|She wanted protection you idiot. She's scared.
Anax|Scared of what?
Philia|I don't know... We should go talk to her again.
Anax|I.. she didn't seem scared. How can you tell?

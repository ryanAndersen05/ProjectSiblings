Philia|You have a lot of explaining to do
Charlotte|Me? What did I do?
Philia|You know what you did. Don't play dumb with me.
Charlotte|I really don't, but I'm sorry about whatever I did.
Philia|Well I'm gonna remind you of what you did, since you're so persistent that you're lost.
Charlotte|Please, I would like to make it right again.
Philia|You ate the last cookie! I specifically told you that one was mine!
Charlotte|You can't claim a cookie Philia. Its fair game to whoever wants it.
Philia|You... bitch!

Philia|Hey Charlotte! What's going on?
Charlotte|Not much...
Charlotte|...Just waiting here.
Philia|What are you waiting for?
Charlotte|Mr. Right. My mom says if you're patient enough, he will come to you.
Philia|I don't think that's how it works...
Charlotte|Not if you have that attitude! You just need to be hopeful and assume everything will be given to you.
Philia|Well alright... good luck with that.
